# Machine Learning Development Guide - AI-Powered Property Measurement & Takeoff Automation Platform (AeroMeasure AI)

## 1. Introduction
This document serves as a step-by-step guide for developing the Machine Learning (ML) component of an AI-powered takeoff automation platform. It outlines data collection, model training, optimization, and deployment.

## 2. Phase 1: Research & Dataset Collection
### 2.1 Define AI Objectives
- Identify the core AI tasks:
  - Object Detection (Detecting property features from aerial images and blueprints)
  - Semantic Segmentation (Classifying surfaces like grass, asphalt, and concrete)
  - OCR for Blueprint Analysis (Extracting text and measurements from blueprints)
- Choose initial models:
  - YOLOv8 for object detection
  - Mask R-CNN / DeepLabV3 for segmentation
  - Tesseract / EasyOCR for blueprint text recognition

### 2.2 Collect & Prepare Data
#### 2.2.1 Data Sources
- Aerial and Satellite Imagery:
  - Google Open Buildings Dataset
  - Microsoft US Building Footprints
  - Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
  - Google Earth API
- Blueprint & CAD Data:
  - Public CAD blueprint repositories
  - Synthetic blueprint generation
  - OpenStreetMap GIS datasets
- Drone Captured Imagery:
  - DJI drone feeds
  - Custom labeled datasets

#### 2.2.2 Data Labeling
- Use Label Studio / CVAT / Roboflow for object annotation.
- Label object classes like:
  - Roofs, driveways, sidewalks, grass, trees, and pools.
  - Building structures in blueprints.
- Augment dataset with flipping, rotation, brightness adjustments.

## 3. Phase 2: Model Selection & Training
### 3.1 Choose Pretrained Models
- Object Detection: YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN
- Segmentation: Mask R-CNN, DeepLabV3
- OCR: Tesseract, EasyOCR with Transformer fine-tuning

### 3.2 Training Pipeline
- Frameworks: Use PyTorch / TensorFlow.
- Training Steps:
  - Preprocess Data (Resize, Normalize, Augment).
  - Split Dataset (80% training, 20% validation).
  - Train Model (Fine-tune YOLO on aerial imagery).
  - Evaluate Model Performance (Precision, Recall, IoU).

### 3.3 Model Evaluation Metrics
- Object Detection: Mean Average Precision (mAP), Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Segmentation: Dice Coefficient, Pixel Accuracy
- OCR: Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER)

## 4. Phase 3: Model Optimization & Deployment
### 4.1 Improve Accuracy
- Hyperparameter tuning: Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and dropout.
- Data Augmentation: Improve dataset variety with artificial augmentations.
- Transfer Learning: Fine-tune models on domain-specific datasets.

### 4.2 Optimize for Speed
- Convert trained models to ONNX / TensorRT for faster inference.
- Apply OpenVINO / TensorFlow Lite for deployment on edge devices.

### 4.3 Deploying the Models
#### 4.3.1 Cloud-Based Inference
- Deploy trained models using:
  - AWS Lambda / GCP Vertex AI for cloud inference.
  - Dockerized API on AWS EC2 / Google Cloud Run.

#### 4.3.2 Edge Processing
- Optimize for mobile and embedded devices:
  - TensorFlow Lite for Mobile (Android/iOS).
  - NVIDIA Jetson for Drone-based AI Inference.

## 5. Phase 4: Testing & Validation
### 5.1 Testing AI Performance
- Compare model predictions against manually verified data.
- Conduct A/B testing on real-world imagery.
- Validate segmentation accuracy using IoU and Dice Coefficient.

### 5.2 Security & Compliance
- Ensure GDPR-compliant data handling.
- Perform adversarial robustness testing against AI attacks.
- Secure cloud deployments using IAM roles, API Gateway authentication.

## 6. Phase 5: Documentation & Maintenance
### 6.1 Document the Process
- Create technical documentation for model training and deployment.
- Document API endpoints and usage.
